Hi! My name is Adam Lieskovsky. I am originally from [Bratislava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bratislava) in [Slovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia), currently living in [Zug, Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zug).

I am working as a Tech Lead and a Software Engineer at [Palantir](https://palantir.com), mainly on products and technology allowing businesses and industries Palantir operates into scale and grow faster.

### Software Engineering

I studied Software Engineering at [the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava (STU)](https://www.stuba.sk/english.html?page_id=132). My focus revolves distributed systems. Tech stack-wise, I do have experience with Ruby, Python, Go and Java and I am well versed with SQL, NoSQL databases, message queues, and event sourcing. I am not good at design or CSS.

### Karate and sports

I have spent a great deal of my youth practicing and competing in karate (Goju-Ryu), leading to the highest level - World Championships. I am a holder of 1st dan (black-belt) and in 2012 I won [3rd place at World University Championships](http://www.fisu.net/en/8th-World-University-Karate-Championship-in-Bratislava-Opened-3133.html?mbID=4722) in the male senior Kumite category. Thanks to karate, I have had a few bones broken, ripped some ligaments (2x ACL) here and there (not necessarily mine). Nevertheless, I have traveled around the world, gained self-discipline, ability to push myself over the edge and respect others. 

These days I favor skiing in the European Alps, mountain-biking, hiking, Zwifting, or rowing on a Concept2 Erg. Since 2020 I also started [road cycling](https://everesting.cc/hall-of-fame/#/hill/3918124272). I tend to track these at [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/199584), but as you can tell from the entries it's a challenge to move from explosive to endurance sports.

One day, I would love to seriously pick up Olympic weightlifting, try some ultra-distance cycling race, or bike up Mauna Kea.

### Our dog Jimmy

In November 2020 we adopted a retired racing Greyhound from Ireland, who was known as "Agony in the garden". We named him Jimmy. Note the retired bit, since he tends to sleep or rest ~20 hours a day.
